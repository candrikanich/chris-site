            <p>For over 18 years, I taught myself HTML and CSS to market Cleveland books by assisting great local authors with their social media and web presence.</p>

            <p>That passion for learning how to code led me to Tech Elevator where I was able to expand my developer skillset and move on to the world of web development.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am a Front-End Developer at Dealer Tire in Cleveland, working on the International Experience team supporting China and Canada.</p>

            <p>When I am not running around with the kids, hanging with my wife, playing volleyball, or enjoying a locally brewed beer, I am most-likely reading up on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

            <p>And yes, I am the Cleveland guy who's twitter account is the same name as Google's parent company: @alphabet.</p>
            
            <p>Shoot me a message, if you want a team player who is willing to learn, wants to be creative and try new things.</p>
